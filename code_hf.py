    def from_pretrained(cls, pretrained_model_name_or_path: Optional[Union[str, os.PathLike]], *model_args, **kwargs):
        r"""
        Instantiate a pretrained pytorch model from a pre-trained model configuration.
        The model is set in evaluation mode by default using `model.eval()` (Dropout modules are deactivated). To train
        the model, you should first set it back in training mode with `model.train()`.
        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.
        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.
        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:
                    - A string, the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                      Valid model ids can be located at the root-level, like `bert-base-uncased`, or namespaced under a
                      user or organization name, like `dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased`.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
                      [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
                    - A path or url to a *tensorflow index checkpoint file* (e.g, `./tf_model/model.ckpt.index`). In
                      this case, `from_tf` should be set to `True` and a configuration object should be provided as
                      `config` argument. This loading path is slower than converting the TensorFlow checkpoint in a
                      PyTorch model using the provided conversion scripts and loading the PyTorch model afterwards.
                    - A path or url to a model folder containing a *flax checkpoint file* in *.msgpack* format (e.g,
                      `./flax_model/` containing `flax_model.msgpack`). In this case, `from_flax` should be set to
                      `True`.
                    - `None` if you are both providing the configuration and state dictionary (resp. with keyword
                      arguments `config` and `state_dict`).
            model_args (sequence of positional arguments, *optional*):
                All remaining positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` method.
            config (`Union[PretrainedConfig, str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Can be either:
                    - an instance of a class derived from [`PretrainedConfig`],
                    - a string or path valid as input to [`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`].
                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuration. Configuration can
                be automatically loaded when:
                    - The model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the *model id* string of a pretrained
                      model).
                    - The model was saved using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and is reloaded by supplying the
                      save directory.
                    - The model is loaded by supplying a local directory as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and a
                      configuration JSON file named *config.json* is found in the directory.
            state_dict (`Dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                A state dictionary to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.
                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own
                weights. In this case though, you should check if using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and
                [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] is not a simpler option.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            from_tf (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a TensorFlow checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            from_flax (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a Flax checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            ignore_mismatched_sizes (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to raise an error if some of the weights from the checkpoint do not have the same size
                as the weights of the model (if for instance, you are instantiating a model with 10 labels from a
                checkpoint with 3 labels).
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            resume_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to delete incompletely received files. Will attempt to resume the download if such a
                file exists.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether ot not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            use_auth_token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, will use the token generated
                when running `transformers-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.
            mirror (`str`, *optional*):
                Mirror source to accelerate downloads in China. If you are from China and have an accessibility
                problem, you can set this option to resolve it. Note that we do not guarantee the timeliness or safety.
                Please refer to the mirror site for more information.
            _fast_init(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Whether or not to disable fast initialization.
            low_cpu_mem_usage(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Tries to not use more than 1x model size in CPU memory (including peak memory) while loading the model.
                This is an experimental feature and a subject to change at any moment.
            torch_dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
                Override the default `torch.dtype` and load the model under this dtype. If `"auto"` is passed the dtype
                will be automatically derived from the model's weights.
                <Tip warning={true}>
                One should only disable *_fast_init* to ensure backwards compatibility with `transformers.__version__ <
                4.6.0` for seeded model initialization. This argument will be removed at the next major version. See
                [pull request 11471](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/11471) for more information.
                </Tip>
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model (e.g.,
                `output_attentions=True`). Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or
                automatically loaded:
                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]). Each key of `kwargs` that
                      corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the
                      supplied `kwargs` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute
                      will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` function.
        <Tip>
        Passing `use_auth_token=True`` is required when you want to use a private model.
