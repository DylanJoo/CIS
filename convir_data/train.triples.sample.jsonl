The Colts finished a distant second in the West to the  Packers  in 1966, and in 1967, with the NFL divided into four divisions of four teams each, went undefeated with two ties through their first 13 games, but lost the game and the Coastal Division championship to the  Los Angeles Rams  on the final Sunday of the season\u2014under newly instituted tiebreakers procedures, L.

In 1968,  Shula and the Colts were considered a favorite to win the NFL championship again, which carried with it an automatic berth what was now becoming popularly known as the \"Super Bowl\" against the champion of the younger AFL.  The NFL champion, in both cases the  Green Bay Packers , had easily won the first two Super Bowls (1967 and 1968) over the AFL winner, establishing for a while then the superiority of the older NFL circuit."}

H. \"Harry\" Cobby (top scoring World War One ace) contacted Wagga resident Hughie Condon and asked him to suggest possible sites suitable for the establishment of an RAAF station. Condon was well suited to the task, being regional Examiner of Airmen with the Dept. of Defence. He recommended a site at the village of Forest Hill, this being situated about five nautical miles East of Wagga. The site was situated above the Murrumbidgee flood plain and was of suitable dimension. It was already serviced by rail, offered frontage to the Sturt Highway, and was sufficiently distant from the town of Wagga Wagga. Cobby flew to inspect the site, arriving in an RAAF Avro Anson. He agreed with Condon's assessment and the go-ahead was soon given. The identified land was resumed from the Brunskill and Lyons families in the first half of 1939 and before long, a Fearnes bus was shuttling workers to the site.It is of note that this was planned as a permanent base and preceded the Empire Air Training Scheme. At this time the Wagga Wagga Council (not yet a city) operated a civilian aerodrome. This was located on Hammond Avenue, East Wagga. Many other councils had hoped to host the new base. The Mayor of Junee, H.G. Weaver, claimed that Junee was a better choice. He said that Junee was less susceptible to fog, had flatter surrounding terrain and could offer railway workshops (the roundhouse) for aircraft repair. The mayor of Narromine was unhappy that his suggested site was not even inspected. The building layout was carefully designed so as to enable the aircraft landing area to have potential for 'all over' operations. Aircraft could potentially touch down anywhere, in any direction, according to the pilots' operational needs.RAAF Forest Hill became operational on 29 July 1940 and initially was home to 2SFTS. Service Flying Training Schools conducted advanced training of graduates of the Elementary Flying Training Schools.At the close of WW2, civilian flying recommenced. A decision was made to accommodate civilian flying operations at Forest Hill. A Bellman hangar was allocated for civilian use and Mobil/Vacuum installed an aircraft refuelling facility. At this time the council aerodrome on Hammond Avenue fell into disuse.With new transport aircraft, such as the Convair Metropolitan, coming into widespread use, it was decided to construct a bitumen runway.

In an article in 1894, the latter singled out Taylor for his ability to combine aesthetic taste with practicality as one of his particular strengths as a designer that contributed to his success. This is likely accurate, as Taylor was not a particularly innovative designer; though versatile in a variety of styles, he did not deviate from the eclecticism popular among most late nineteenth-century American designers; nor at first glance does he seem to have developed any new handling of space, materials, or volumes. He seems to have been mostly focused on giving clients what they wanted and keeping in touch with popular design trends, objectives that would have served him well in the growing corporate culture of St. Louis."}

The match was nicknamed \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to punching power of Ch\u00e1vez and blinding speed of Taylor. Ch\u00e1vez was the epitome of the \"Mexican\" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Ch\u00e1vez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Ch\u00e1vez slowly punished Taylor.

He was named 1981's  NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year  and Defensive Player of the Year, making him as of 2013 the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award. Taylor's arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981.

The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach  Bill Walsh  used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned  guard   John Ayers , the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team's trainer he would be surprised if the linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor's life for $2 million.", "neg_passage": "Thomas visited the home of historian  A.

Some of Taylor's earliest inspiration came from his family. His maternal grandfather exposed him to Native traditions by taking him to  powwow s and his maternal uncle was a well-known wildlife painter. Taylor graduated from  Will Rogers High School  in 1969, where he played baseball and football. He went on a sports scholarship to  Central Missouri State  in  Warrensburg, Missouri  for a short time until he was injured during the first semester. He dropped out of Central Missouri State to transfer to the  University of Tulsa  but was drafted before he completed the move. Taylor was in the  Navy  from 1970 to 1972.

When the team for the Test was announced, the Australian selectors had included the name of  Peter Taylor  from  NSW . Thinking that a mistake in names had been made, the Australian media besieged the home of the talented young NSW opener  Mark Taylor , thinking that he had been selected to play his first Test. Although history shows that Mark Taylor had a substantial Test career later on, the selectors had made no mistake in the name. NSW off-spinner Peter Taylor had impressed some selectors (especially  Greg Chappell ) with his all-round abilities during the previous season's  Sheffield Shield  final. He was noted as an off-spinner who really spun the ball and a number of the wickets he took during the test match were attributed to his 'loop' (the deceptive flight of a heavily spun cricket ball) and bounce from his unusual but high bowling action. Considering Peter Taylor's limited first-class experience, the selection was risky. Given the state of Australian cricket at this point, and the fact that the Ashes had already been lost, such a selection could be considered desperate. The selection was so shocking that the media quickly dubbed him \"Peter Who?\", and he became something of a celebrity leading up to the match. Spectators voiced their opinion too on the first day of the match. \"Aussie Selectors couldn't pick  Bill Lawry 's Nose\" declared one banner.

After his second positive test he gave up drugs for five years as a third positive test would have ended his career. As he approached retirement, however, he looked forward to picking up the habit again, saying in his second autobiography, \"I saw blow as the only bright spot in my future.\" After his retirement, he began abusing drugs on a regular basis. He went through drug rehab twice in 1995, only to later be arrested twice over a three-year span for attempting to buy cocaine from undercover police officers. During this period, he lived almost exclusively in his home with white sheets covering his windows and only associated with other drug users. Taylor later said, \"I had gotten really bad. I mean my place was almost like a  crack house .\" In his second autobiography, Taylor admitted that he had begun using drugs as early as his rookie season in the NFL. He has also stated that his first wife, Linda, mother to his three children, once had to come pick him up from a crack house during his playing career.", "neg_passage": "On April 15, 2000, Taylor, a  restricted free agent , received a one-year tender that earned him $1.027 million in 2000.

Taylor did not completely agree with the Australian Government's  White Australia policy , which sought to limit immigrants to whites only. Taylor argued that Australia's agricultural resources were limited, and that this, together with other environmental factors, meant that Australia would not be able to support the population goal of 100 million which some optimistically predicted. Moreover, he claimed that due to climactic factors, the interior of Australia would be best settled by broad-headed  Mongoloids  who were better adapted to the environment.  He was severely criticised as unpatriotic for his views on Australia's future development. A textbook he had written containing these views was banned from schools by the  Western Australian  education authority. Taylor was a strong exponent of the controversial concept of  environmental determinism  with the view that \"physical environment determines culture.\" In 1927, he became the first President of the Geographical Society of New South Wales."}

Harvey followed his elder brother  Merv  in making his Test debut in January 1948, aged 19 and three months.

Harvey was best known for his extravagant footwork and flamboyant strokeplay.
