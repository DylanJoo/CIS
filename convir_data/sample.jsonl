After Division Championships in 1968 and '69 the Jets struggled to records of 4\u201310, 6\u20138, 7\u20137, and 4\u201310.  His most memorable moment in those four seasons came on September 24, 1972, when he and his boyhood idol  Johnny Unitas  combined for 872 passing yards in Baltimore. Namath threw for 496 yards and six touchdowns and Unitas 376 yards and three in a 44\u201334 New York victory over the Colts, its first against Baltimore since Super Bowl III. The game is considered by many NFL experts to be the finest display of passing in a single game in league history."}
